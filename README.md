# Water-Re-Circulation-Simulation
Based on the rational method and some basic equipment acquirable for less than 200$USD, This MATLAB application (R2019b) proposes the simulation of water re-circulation for conventional agricultural systems of potatoes, the document is in Spanish, and accessible through this link: http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=2&sid=5747ebad-a38f-4710-b54f-c1b1da9bcae3%40sdc-v-sessmgr02&bdata=Jmxhbmc9ZXMmc2l0ZT1lZHMtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=cat07441a&AN=cpu.833672. It allows to have an idea of the quantities of reused nutrients and water. It's very important to say that in this simulation, the water concentration is constant when in reality it should be a second degree differential equation, that only further research can define.

Here you find two things, a folder with the raw code and a compress folder with inside the standalone app.
To run the app, install the MATLAB RunTime found in the "for_redistribution" folder, and then run the app found in the "for_testing" folder.
